					<h2>JavaScript</h2>
					<p><small>imperative animations</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						JavaScript always gets executed by the main thread. Nonetheless, JavaScript gives you greater
						control over animations, so you’re better off using it in some situations. While CSS is ideal for simple
						transitions, JavaScript is recommended for animations with advanced effects such as bouncing. Animations that
						allow the user to pause or rewind should also be animated with JavaScript. JavaScript is necessary to implement
						certain effects like parallax scrolling. You can also use JavaScript to control CSS animations.

					<h2>JavaScript Animation Tips</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Use <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code></li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Decouple animations from events</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Keep your JavaScript code concise</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Don’t use jQuery</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						1. Use requestAnimationFrame()
						Instead of using setTimeOut() and setInterval(), use the native JavaScript method requestAnimationFrame() to
						execute your animation code at the best time for the browser. This method chooses the appropriate frame rate for
						the user’s device, so mobile visitors will see a different frame rate than desktop users.
						2. Decouple animations from events
						The code responsible for handling events such as scrolling should be kept separate from your animation code.You
						should decouple events from the code that
						handles requestAnimationFrame().
						3. Keep your JavaScript code concise
						Be wary of adding huge chunks of JavaScript to your web page. If your code becomes unwieldy, you could try using
						web workers to execute JavaScript animations on a different thread.
						4. Don’t use jQuery
						Stay away from older animation libraries like jQuery.

					<h3>Which CSS Properties to Animate?</h3>
					<p>Main types of CSS properties</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Layout properties</li>
						<li>Paint properties</li>
						<li>Composite properties</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						• Layout properties - These determine the size and placement of page elements. Animations that change an
						element’s width and height can affect the placement of other page elements, which can cause a chain reaction
						known as “layout thrash.” Since animations that change the page layout are especially costly, they are best
						avoided.
						• Paint properties - These define the appearance of page elements. Making changes to properties such as color
						requires repainting, which can be costly. That said, simple animations that require a small portion of the
						viewport to be repainted may have a negligible impact on overall performance. Larger animations that require
						repainting may not be worth the effort.
						• Composite properties - Which include transform and opacity, are your best friends for creating CSS animations
						with minimal cost. With transform, you can scale and rotate animations without affecting the page layout.

					<p>Good Practice</p>

						<li>opacity</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">You can do almost everything using these four options that you can using layout properties
						without affecting the positioning of other page elements. For example, to change the size of an image, use
						scale() rather than width().</aside>

					<h2>CSS</h2>
					<p><small>declarative animations</small></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Animation</li>
						<li>Transition</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						CSS animations are handled by the browser’s compositor thread rather than the main thread
						responsible for painting and styling. Consequently, such animations are unaffected by the main thread’s more
						expensive tasks. Of course, animations that trigger the paint or layout events will require work from the main
						thread, which negates the benefits of using CSS animations.

					<h2>CSS Animation Tips</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Avoid simultaneous animations</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Examine your animations in slow motion</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Delay all animations by a fraction of a second</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Don’t bind CSS animations to scroll</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Combine CSS with SVGs</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">1. Avoid simultaneous animations
						Animations that run smoothly in isolation may not work so well on a page alongside dozens of other animations.
						More than two animations going at the same time is likely to cause lag. Therefore, timing your animations so that
						they don’t all execute all at once is vital to maintaining consistent performance. This can be accomplished by
						adding transition delays.
						2. Examine your animations in slow motion
						3. Delay all animations by a fraction of a second
						Since the browser is very busy when your page begins loading, delaying all animations until a few hundred
						milliseconds after the initial load event can make a noticeable difference in overall page performance.
						4. Don’t bind CSS animations to scroll
						Animations that follow the viewport as the user scrolls are not only annoying, but they also drag down the
						performance of everything else on screen.
						5. Combine CSS with SVGs
						Scalable vector graphics, or SVGs, are excellent for animations since they can be scaled without degrading
						resolution.

					<h2>When to Use Will-Change?</h2>
					<pre>
						<code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
							.element {
								will-change: transform, opacity;
							}
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">If you’ve tried everything else and are still having performance problems, then you might
						want to try adding the will-change property to your animations. As its name implies, will-change indicates that
						an element’s properties will change so that the browser can make appropriate preparations. Since using
						will-change consumes resources, be warned that overuse can lead to further performance problems.</aside>

				<h2>Testing</h2>
				<aside class="notes">Performance testing should be an ongoing process while building animations for your web app.
					The longer you wait to identify rendering issues, the harder it becomes to pinpoint the root of the problem.
					The developer tools for Chrome, Firefox and Safari offer a frame-by-frame breakdown of paint and render events
					under their Network tabs. This information can help you optimize animations as you design them. If you’re using
					Chrome, look under the Rendering tab in the DevTools console for additional features such as an FPS meter.The
					user’s screen size has a major impact on how animations display, so be sure to test your project on multiple
					platforms including mobile devices.

				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<aside class="notes">Optimizing animations for the web is a relatively straight-forward process. Choosing engaging
					animations that will entice new visitors to stay on your website is more challenging because you have to consider
					your audience. In addition to tracking how your site’s technical performance affects conversions, take note of the
					impact that web animations have on your bottom line. If your animations aren’t helping, then they are just wasting
					resources better spent elsewhere.</aside>
